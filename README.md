# UnitTest Notes


Unit tests help find bugs early in the development process, making them less costly to resolve.

Unit testing promotes better code design by encouraging modular, testable code, which improves maintainability over time.

Unit tests act as a safety net when making changes, ensuring modifications don't introduce unexpected problems.

Unit tests can serve as a form of living documentation, making it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand how the code is supposed to function.

While there's an initial investment, a good suite of unit tests can lead to faster development in the long run due to reduced time spent debugging and fixing unexpected errors.
